This app is using Lumen Framework. It's a very simple app. There is no auth or CSRF protection.

There are only three rotes. One for the teacher's ```/teachers``` , disciplines  ```/disciplines``` and other to link teacher disciplines  ```/teachers/disciplines```.

The app will check if the cpf and email the teacher already exists and if age < 18 years, if not it'll create a new teacher and store. Otherwise updates the player's scores. The discipline checker will only check by name (case insensitive). Each creation / changethe app linked teacher x discipline will check if the teacher is already linked to a subject. Any problem on that the app will reponse with 422 code and an array of erros. All routes the app check if informations compatibles of data types.
